Getting a valid API key
-----------------------

To use this movie app, you will need a valid `api_key` from The Movie Database. Follow these steps to obtain an API key:

1. Go to The Movie Database [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and sign up for a free account.

2. Once you have signed up, go to the [API page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate a new API key.

3. Copy the generated API key to your clipboard.

Replacing [YOUR_API_KEY]
------------------------

Now that you have a valid `api_key`, you can replace the `[YOUR_API_KEY]` placeholder in the code with the actual value. To do this:

1. Open the `main.js` file in your code editor.

2. Find the line that says `const apiKey = '[YOUR_API_KEY]';`.

3. Replace `[YOUR_API_KEY]` with the actual `api_key` value you obtained from The Movie Database website.

4. Save the `main.js` file and restart the movie app.

That's it! Your movie app should now be able to retrieve movie data from The Movie Database using your valid `api_key`.
